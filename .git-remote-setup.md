# GitHub Repository Setup Steps

## Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/organizations/vzbly/repositories/new
   (Or: https://github.com/vzbly → "New repository")
2. Repository name: `vzbly-site-v2`
3. Choose visibility (Public/Private)
4. **DO NOT** check any boxes (no README, .gitignore, or license)
5. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: After Repository Creation
Once you've created the repository, I'll run these commands:
- `git add .` - Stage all files
- `git commit -m "Initial commit"` - Create initial commit
- `git remote add origin https://github.com/vzbly/vzbly-site-v2.git` - Add remote
- `git branch -M main` - Ensure branch is named main
- `git push -u origin main` - Push to GitHub

**Important**: Make sure you're logged into GitHub as the vzbly account when creating the repository!
